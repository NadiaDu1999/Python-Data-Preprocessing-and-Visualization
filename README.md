# 🏃‍♀️ Half Marathon Training + Data Analysis Project! 🏃‍♀️

With my first half marathon coming up very soon (and honestly still feeling unsure if I can finish it 😅), I decided to turn this into a portfolio project to analyze my training performance!

I retrieved my running data from Strava (a fitness tracking app), then applied Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing my progress.

## Data wrangling steps included

1. Extracting the information from existing columns.

2. Checking missing values.

3. Handling date-time data type.

4. Converting the data type.

5. Checking and handling outliers.

6. Changing column names.

After cleaning the data, I visualised and analysed key training patterns to better understand my progress and readiness for race day.

Wish me luck 🍀
